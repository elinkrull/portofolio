				<p class="about-me-text">I am 37 year old woman based just outside Oslo.
					I am a wife, mother, student, naprapath, dancer, mountain-climber, scuba-diver and a
					horseback rider
					who loves to spend time out in the garden. As you probably understand by now, I am never bored.
					I am outgoing and like to take on a challenge. I had no experience with coding when I started
					front-end development studies, but the more knowledge I manage to acquire, the more curious I get
					about the various coding languages. I can be stubborn and I don't like to give up, so I think this
					could be perfect for me.
